User Manual for Joshua Vanderstoops simple c proxy

Features: 
	- When global integer variables item1, item2, and item3 are all set to 0, 
		this proxy will be transparent for the test websites provided on 
		the webpage: http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/assignment1.html
		this configuration of the proxy can be done by accessing the source code
		'proxy_vanderstoop.c' and on lines 36-38, edit all integer values to show 
		int item1 = 0; //floppy
		int item2 = 0; //spongebob
		int item3 = 0; //curling
	- If you wish to block one of the three options above, using the same process, 
		simply switch any '0' to '1' to turn on the browser block for the specified 
		item. Turning any of them on will not only block URL's containing blocked
		words, but also block any page that contains a blocked word in the text/body
		of the page. 
	- This proxy is NOT dynamically configurable, and will not accept any user input 
		during runtime.
	- While blocking an item is switched on, the user should be careful not to reload 
		the main Assignment 1 page(linked above). This will result in that page 
		being blocked, as it contains all 3 blocked words in the body of the page.
Usage:
	- First, move onto any suitable university computer using the commands: 
		ssh your.username@linux.cpsc.ucalgary.ca
		YourPassword1235
	- now, move proxy_vanderstoop.c onto the computer using any method you would like,
		I use FileZilla.
	- now compile the program using the command:
		gcc -o proxy.exe proxy_vanderstoop.c
	- In your browser, ensure that you are ready to configure your proxy settings, 
		the main assignment 1 page (link above) is open, and your cache is clear. 
	- run the program using the command: 
		./proxy.exe
	- now, you will see some information printed to the terminal. Use the IP address 
		that is visible, and port 8869 on your web browser proxy settings, and 
		save that setting. 
	- while the Assignment 1 main page is open, scroll down to the "Testing" section, 
		and click whatever links you want. If you have any blocked items turned on
		the page will not be visible to you, and you will instead see an error page. 
	- to end the program, simply type the command ctrl + c and it will stop. 
	- From this point you can reconfigure your blocked items, save, recompile and run 
		the proxy again.
